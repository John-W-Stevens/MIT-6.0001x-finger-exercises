# Estimate the probability that a randomly chosen American is both male and
# weighs more than 180 pounds. Assume that 50% of the population is male, and
# that the wieghts of the male population are normally distributed with a mean of
# 210 pounds and a standard deviation of 30 pounds. (Hint: think about using
# the empirical rule).
