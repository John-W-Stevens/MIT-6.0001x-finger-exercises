# You are wandering through a forest and see a field of delicious-looking mushrooms.
# You fill your basket with them, and head home to preare to cook them up and server
# them to your husband. Before you cook them, however, he demands that you consult a
# book about local mushroom species to check whether they are poisonous. The book says
# that 80% of the mushrooms in the local forest are poisonous. However, you compare
# your mushrooms to the ones pictured in the book, and decide that you are 95 certain
# that your mushrooms are safe. How comfortable should you be serving to your husband
# (assuming that you rather not become a widow)?
